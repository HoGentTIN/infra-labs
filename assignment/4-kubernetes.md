# Lab 4: Container orchestration with Kubernetes

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), Google's container orchestration engine.

## Learning goals

- Understanding the basic architecture of Kubernetes
- Being able to operate a Kubernetes cluster
    - Applying changes using manifest files
- Being able to manipulate Kubernetes resources
    - Pods
    - Controllers: ReplicaSets, Deployments, Services
    - Organising applications: Labels, Selectors
- Deploying a multi-tier application on a Kubernetes cluster

## Assessment criteria (M4)

To meet the standard, show that the following criteria are met:

- [ ] Demonstrate that your Kubernetes cluster is running and that you are able to manage it:
    - Open the dashboard to show what's running on the cluster: nodes, pods, services, deployments, etc.
    - Also show these from the command line (using `kubectl`)
- [ ] Demonstrate the applications that are running on the cluster:
    - Show them in the web browser
    - From the command line, show which resources are used by each application (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.)
- [ ] Show an example of filtering by label and an operation on the filtered resources (e.g. delete all resources with a certain label)
- [ ] Scale the echo-all deployment to 5 replica's using the manifest file
- [ ] Demonstrate that you understand how your setup works beyond copying the assignment instructions to an LLM and pasting the results to the terminal or your lab report
- [ ] Show your lab report and cheat sheet! It should contain screenshots of consecutive steps and console output of commands you used.

In order to exceed expectations, implement one or more of the suggested extensions given throughout this assignment, or come up with your own.

## Additional resources

Kubernetes is a current topic that attracts a lot of interest. That also means that there's a lot of information available and that it's sometimes hard to find good intro-level resources. Here's a small selection that may help you get acquainted with Kubernetes:

- [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
- [Minikube Documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
- [Learning Kubernetes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-kubernetes/) course at Linkedin Learning. Available for HOGENT students through [Academic Software](https://www.academicsoftware.eu).

If you think you will use Kubernetes professionally, or if you want to gain a much deeper understanding of how it works, the following resources may be of use:

- Martin, P. (2021) *Kubernetes: Preparing for the CKA and CKAD Certifications.* Apress
    - HOGENT staff and students have free access to the ebook from the campus or via VPN [through this link](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-6494-2)
- Hightower, K. (2021) *Kubernetes The Hard Way.* Retrieved 2022-09-10 from <https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way>
    - Instructions to set up Kubernetes manually. Anyone running Kubernetes in production should know the platform inside out. This guide helps you to install and configure all the necessary components, which is probably the best way to really understand how it works under the hood.

## 4.1. Set up the lab environment

- Install the necessary tools on your physical system (see <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/> for instructions on each desktop platform)
    - `minikube`, a tool to set up a local Kubernetes environment. It's probably best to [use VirtualBox as the driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

        ```console
        minikube config set driver virtualbox
        ```

    - `kubectl`, a command-line tool to run commands against Kubernetes clusters
- Start Minikube with `minikube start` and follow [the instructions in the Minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to get started
- Start the Kubernetes Dashboard:
    - Enable the appropriate Minikube plugins:

        ```console
        minikube addons enable metrics-server
        minikube addons enable dashboard
        ```

    - Start the Dashboard with `minikube dashboard`

Possible extensions:

- Issue the command `minikube node add` twice to spin up two extra nodes so you have an actual cluster with a control plane node and two workers.
    - By default, Minikube runs a single Kubernetes (control plane) node. For the purpose of this lab assignment, that's sufficient, but you will get a better feel of how a multi-node cluster works in a multi-node environment (control plane + worker nodes).
    - Remark that there's a command that immediately starts multiple nodes: `minikube start --nodes 3`. However, this command sometimes hangs during execution. Starting nodes individually is more reliable.
    - Also remark that when you're running a multi-node cluster, Minikube doesn't handle LoadBalancer access (which is the standard way to expose an application to the internet on a production cluster) very well. If you want to access a web application running on your cluster, you will probably need to enter the IP address of the node that actually runs the application Pod.
- Run another driver than VirtualBox, e.g. Docker or KVM2. See the [Minikube drivers documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/) for more information.
- Use an alternative Kubernetes distribution for local use, e.g. [k3s](https://k3s.io/) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

## 4.2. Basic operation

At this point, we assume you have a running instance of Minikube with at least a control plane node and that `kubectl` is configured to communicate with that instance.

Before you begin, a quick tip: the command `kubectl get all` is very useful to show you everything that is running on your Kubernetes cluster. Whenever you're changing the state of the cluster by creating new objects, you should check the changes with `kubectl get <object-type>` or just `kubectl get all`.

You can get an near real-time view on what happens on your cluster by issuing the following command in a separate Bash terminal:

```console
watch -n1 kubectl get all
```

Add option `-o wide` if you want to see on which node each

The `watch` command will repeat the `kubectl` command every second (`-n1`) and show the result.

### 4.2.1. Hello world!

- Follow the steps in the [Hello Minikube tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/) to create a simple deployment and service and to learn to use the Kubernetes dashboard.
- Next, follow the [Learn Kubernetes Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) tutorial where you will learn to deploy a containerized application on a cluster, access it, scale it to multiple instances, and update it with a new version.
- Check that you can view the discussed applications in a webbrowser, or by using `curl` from the command line.

### 4.2.2. Working with manifest files

Usually, you won't be deploying applications with commands like you did in the previous step. You would write a manifest file that describes the desired state of all objects that are needed to run the application. Kubernetes manifest files are written in YAML, which should be familiar to you by now!

In the directory [../kubernetes/4.2](../kubernetes/4.2), you will find examples of some basic manifest files:

- [bootcamp-deployment.yml](../kubernetes/4.2/bootcamp-deployment.yml): describes a deployment for the bootcamp app from the previous step
- [bootcamp-service.yml](../kubernetes/4.2/bootcamp-service.yml): describes a service for the echo app
- [bootcamp-all.yml](../kubernetes/4.2/bootcamp-all.yml): a file containing both the deployment and service definition.
    - This Deployment also contains a ReplicaSet that ensures two pods are running at all times

You will notice that in the last file, some lines only contain `---`. This is YAML syntax to mark the beginning of a new "document" (in YAML terminology). This way, you can combine the definitions of all Kubernetes objects that you want to create in a single YAML file.

Let's deploy the application using the separate files first. Open a terminal in directory `4.2/` and follow the instructions below. Be sure to check the result after each command, or use the trick with the `watch` command introduced previously.

```console
kubectl apply -f echo-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f echo-service.yml
```

This will first create the Deployment and launch the pods. The second command ensures that the app is available for users. When the Service is active, you should be able to view the application in a web browser with `minikube service bootcamp-service`, or by surfing to `http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT` where `IP_ADDRESS` is the IP address of the node where the pod is running and `PORT` is the port number mentioned when you list the service with `kubectl get service`.

You can do the same thing in one go by combining the code of both files into a single file.

```console
kubectl apply -f echo-all.yml
```

Remark that this file is not an exact copy/paste of the previous ones. Indeed, each object should be given a name, and we chose different names for both deployments. Consequently, at this time, two instances of the same app are running at the same time.

Check all components that are currently running, try to access both instances of the service.

If you want to make a change to an existing Kubernetes object, edit the manifest file and run the command:

```console
kubectl apply -f <manifest-file.yml>
```

For example, increase the number of replicas of the echoserver app (currently two) in the manifest file `echo-all.yml`, and apply the change. Check whether this operation was successful and find out on which node each pod is running (which command can you use for this?). Try to send multiple requests to the service (e.g. curl in a for loop) and check whether all pods process requests by looking at the logs of each pod (with which command?).

You can also try to update the image of the app to a newer version. In the image name `docker.io/jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1`, change `v1` to `v2` and apply the change. Observe how the cluster performs a rolling update on the application and check afterwards (in the browser or using `curl`) whether the new version is running.

Possible extensions:

- If one of the nodes in the cluster becomes unavailable (e.g. `minikube node stop minikube-m03). What happens? Is the application still available? Are the pods still running? Is a pod automatically rescheduled to another node? What if you restart the node? Will the cluster "heal" itself completely or not?

## 4.3. Labels and selectors

When you use Kubernetes in production, your environment will quickly become quite complex. An application will consist of several pods (front-end, API service, storage/database, etc.), deployments, etc. You may want to host several environments (development, staging/acceptance, production) on the same Kubernetes cluster.

In order to make sense of it all, you can add labels to all Kubernetes objects that you create. A label is nothing more than a key-value pair, both of which can be chosen freely. For example, you could define a key `environment` with possible values `development`, `acceptance` and `production`. If you consequently add the `environment` label to all pods that you launch, you can list e.g. all pods that are part of the `development` environment with so-called Selectors.

You can view labels with the command `kubectl get <item-type> --show-labels`. List the currently running pods with their labels.

You can search for Kubernetes resources with specific labels using the `--selector` or `-l` option, e.g.:

```console
kubectl get pods --selector TAG=VALUE
kubectl get pods --selector TAG!=VALUE
kubectl get pods --selector TAG=VALUE,TAG=VALUE
kubectl get pods -l 'TAG in (VAL1,VAL2,VAL3,...)'
kubectl get pods -l 'TAG notin (VAL1,VAL2,VAL3,...)'
```

You can also perform other actions using selectors, e.g.

```console
kubectl delete pods -l TAG=VALUE
```

This also works for other kinds of Kubernetes objects (Deployments, ReplicaSets, Services, etc.).

### 4.3.1. Manipulating labels manually

Labels can be added to existing Kubernetes resources with `kubectl label <item> <key>=<value>`. Add the `--overwrite` option if the key already exists. A label can be removed with `kubectl label <item> <key>-` (i.e. add a dash to the end of the key name).

Add the label `application_type=demo` to the three pods that are part of the Deployment `echo-all-deployment`.

Try to change the `application_type` of one of the three pods to another value without the `--overwrite` option and note the error message. Add the option so the change is actually made.

Try to delete all pods with `application_type` equals to `demo`. Since this Deployment has a ReplicaSet that ensures 2 pods are launched, the deleted pods will be replaced immediately. What do you notice when you look at the labels of the three pods currently running?

Remove the `application_type` label from the pod that still has it.

Finally, remove all Kubernetes resources currently running on the cluster (Pods, Deployments, Services).

### 4.3.2. Setting labels in the manifest file

Usually, you won't be managing labels manually. They should instead be specified in the manifest file. You can add a section `labels:` to the `metadata:` section.

In the manifest file [4.3/example-pods-with-labels.yml](../kubernetes/4.3/example-pods-with-labels.yml), we defined a number of Pods with labels that are representative to how you could do it in practice.

Let's say you have an application that consists of 3 pods working together: a frontend, backend/API service and a database. You want to host a development, acceptance and production environment on this Kubernetes cluster. The app version running in production is currently v1.0, while acceptance and development are on v2.0. Each pod is owned by different teams (e.g. the web team develops the frontend, the db team manages the database, etc.).

This subdivision results in the following labels:

- `env`: can be either `development`, `acceptance`, or `production`
- `team`: either `web`, `api`, or `db`
- `pod_type`: either `frontend`, `backend`, or `db`
- `release_version`: `1.0` or `2.0`

Launch the pods by applying the manifest file.

- Select pods in the production environment
- Select pods *not* in the production environment
- Select pods in the development and acceptance environment (remark that logically, this is the same as the previous question, but you need to formulate your selector query differently)
- Select pods with release version 2.0
- Select pods owned by the API-team with release version 2.0
- Delete all pods in the development environment
- What is the quickest way to launch the pods you just deleted?

## 4.4. Deploy a multi-tier web application

Open the Kubernetes documentation site in a webbrowser and follow the tutorial [Deploying PHP Guestbook application with Redis](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/). Keep lab notes!

Possible extensions:

- You can also follow the tutorial [Example: Deploying WordPress and MySQL with Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/mysql-wordpress-persistent-volume/).
- Use Helm to deploy a multi-tier application

## 4.5. Clean up

When you're done with the lab assignment (**and only after you successfully demonstrated your setup!**) you can clean up all Kubernetes resources currently running on the cluster. What is the quickest way to delete all objects?
